Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 

No,
The models:
vgg : classified Dog_01.jpg as golden retriever
resnet : classified Dog_01.jpg as golden retriever
alexnet : classified Dog_01.jpg as irish setter, red setter
So vgg and resnet classified the breed of the dog to be the same breed but alexnet classified it as a different breed.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
NO,
vgg : classified Dog_01.jpg as golden retriever and Dog_02.jpg as golden retriever 
resnet : classified Dog_01.jpg as golden retriever and Dog_02.jpg as golden retriever 
alexnet : classified Dog_01.jpg as irish setter, red setter and Dog_02.jpg as golden retriever
So vgg and resnet classified the breeds of the both dog images (Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg= golden retriever) to be the same breed but alexnet classified it wrong for Dog_01.jpg(irish setter) and correctly for Dog_02.jpg(golden retriever)

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes all three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg(Bear_01.jpg)and Object_Name_01.jpg(Coffee_Mug01.jpg) to not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Both VGG and ResNet classified the dog breeds correctly as golden retriever for Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg 
but alexnet classified as irish setter, red setter, 
though all three classified the dog and notdog images correctly
Overall best performing model architechture was resnet as it took less time 0:0:4 than vgg 0:0:8.
Hence the answer accordingly is resnet.
